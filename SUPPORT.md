Need help with the Decision Record CLI (`drctl`)? Here are the recommended paths.

## Self-service Resources

- **README.md** – project overview, architecture, and usage examples.
- **AGENTS.md** – collaboration agreements, design principles, and current roadmap.
- **Decision records** – example DRs in `decisions-example/` illustrate lifecycle conventions.
- **CLI help** – run `drctl --help` or `drctl <command> --help` for command-specific options.

## Questions & Discussions

- Open a GitHub discussion or issue if you need clarification, have feature ideas, or want to share learnings.
- For workflow or governance questions, consider drafting a meta decision record (`drctl decision new meta ...`) to capture the reasoning.

## Bug Reports

- Review open issues first.
- Include reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behaviour, environment details (`node -v`, OS), and relevant logs.

## Security Concerns

- Follow the responsible disclosure process described in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md). Do **not** open public issues for vulnerabilities.

## Code of Conduct

- All community interactions are governed by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please report unacceptable behaviour via the channels listed there.

Thank you for helping build a calmer, more transparent reasoning ecosystem!
