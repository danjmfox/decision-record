# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Decision Record CLI is currently pre-1.0. We aim to respond to security reports affecting the `main` branch and the latest tagged release (if any). Older snapshots may not receive fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please avoid filing public issues for security problems.

1. Email the maintainers at [security@security@daedaluscoaching.com](mailto:security@daedaluscoaching.com) with:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code.
   - Any known impact or exploitation details.
2. You will receive acknowledgement within **3 business days**.
3. We will work with you to assess severity, develop a fix, and coordinate disclosure.

If email is unavailable, send a direct message to the maintainers through the collaboration channels referenced in `AGENTS.md`, requesting a secure communication path.

## Disclosure Process

1. We confirm and triage the issue, assigning a CVSS score when appropriate.
2. A fix is developed, reviewed, and tested.
3. We coordinate a release and publish an advisory summarising the vulnerability, impact, and mitigation steps.
4. Credit is given to the reporter unless you request otherwise.

## Preferred Languages

We can communicate in English. If translation support is required, let us know in your initial report.

Thank you for helping keep the `drctl` ecosystem secure.
