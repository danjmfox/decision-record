# DR--20251101--meta--revision-commands

## 🧭 Context

Today we corrected a decision record directly in git. While acceptable for a quick fix, it leaves little audit trail and may confuse collaborators (“your copy differs from mine”). We already track significant lifecycle changes (draft → accept, supersede), but we lack CLI commands for minor corrections and moderate revisions that should still be traceable.

## ⚖️ Options Considered

| Option                                                             | Description                    | Outcome                                                                                                             | Rationale                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manual edits only                                                  | Continue editing DRs directly  | Rejected                                                                                                            | Inconsistent changelog/version handling; little visibility.                           |
| Single revision command                                            | Add one generic `drctl revise` | Considered                                                                                                          | Clearer than manual edits, but conflates tiny corrections with substantive revisions. |
| Split commands: `correction` (bugfix) and `revise` (minor version) | Accepted                       | Distinguishes semantic intent, matches versioning expectations (`x.x.1` vs `x.(x+1)`), keeps lifecycle flow intact. |

## 🧠 Decision

Introduce two new CLI commands:

- `drctl correction <id> [--note ...]` – applies small factual/typo fixes. Bumps patch version (`1.0.0 → 1.0.1`), updates `lastEdited`, and appends a changelog entry (default message “Minor correction”).
- `drctl revise <id> [--note ...] [--confidence ...]` – applies moderate updates (context, confidence, metadata). Bumps minor version (`1.0.0 → 1.1.0`), updates `lastEdited`, and records the reason.

Both commands preserve the Markdown body unless changes are made, and neither affects lifecycle status. Larger shifts (supersede, retire) continue using existing commands.

## 🪶 Principles

- **Traceable history** – Every adjustment leaves a changelog entry with semantic meaning.
- **Semantic versioning for DRs** – Patch = correction, minor = revision, major reserved for future use if needed.
- **Low friction** – Provide CLI helpers so editors avoid ad-hoc manual edits.

## 🔁 Lifecycle

Status: `draft`. Promote after commands, tests, and documentation are implemented.

## 🧩 Reasoning

Differentiating “corrections” from “revisions” clarifies intent: patch updates communicate bug fixes, minor bumps signal content changes, and existing lifecycle commands handle status transitions. Providing CLI support ensures the changelog and version numbers stay in sync without manual editing. A future `--no-commit` option or staged-file guard still applies.

## 🔄 Next Actions

- Implement TDD for `correction` (patch bump) and `revise` (minor bump) commands.
- Update README/AGENTS to describe version semantics (`x.y.z`).
- Consider migration tooling for existing DRs (optional).

## 🧠 Confidence

Medium – concept aligns with versioning practices; implementation pending.
